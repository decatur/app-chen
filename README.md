This is a client/server web framework:
* Supports real time eventing via Server Send Events
* Supports single page applications and in-app navigation
* Supports on-the-fly sub-pages
* Depends on Flask and MongoDB only
* Uses es6 modules and plain vanilla JS

This is work in progress.

dom.EventSource is receiving events even if browser tab is not visible.
